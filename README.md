Devs decided that Stats through Skills should be removed from main.

Personal copy that uses Penki-Jenki's method to work around the removal.

Currently playing on build 2025-05-27-0430.

Tested to work the same as the old Stats Through Skills.



Formula is ([sum of skills in catagory]-3)^0.4 which will vary from +0 to +5 to each stat.

At rank 1 in 4 skill you get +1, and at rank 10 in all skills with get you +5
